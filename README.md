# Random Searching vs Simulated Annealing

Program compares two probabilistic techniques for approximating the global optimum of a given function:
1. Random Searching
2. Simulated Annealing

All methods are compared in terms of: 
- accuracy,
- number of iterations needed to find extrema,

## Technolgies used
1. Matlab
